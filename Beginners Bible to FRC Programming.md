<h2 id="an-introduction.">An introduction.</h2>
<p>Hey you, yeah you. You think you know something about programming? Good, you‚Äôll probably be useful, but you have a long path to follow little one. Don‚Äôt know a thing? Well then the goal of this little document is to get you from knowing nothing, to writing useful programs for FIRST Robotics, and preparing you for a future in writing software.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-start-mysterious-man-of-the-past">How do I start mysterious man of the past?</h3>
<p>In my opinion the easiest way to learn programming is by doing, what have you always thought would be cool in programming? What sounds cool? What looks cool? Is it too difficult? This way of thinking will eventually drive you into a project, and participating in such projects will make you a batter overall programmer.</p>
<h3 id="but-mysterious-man-of-the-past-im-not-creative.">But mysterious man of the past, I‚Äôm not creative.</h3>
<p>Well fear not, as a programmer creativity can come later. So for a start we‚Äôll be looking at javascript, and we‚Äôll later move into java for actual robot code. The reason we start in javascript is because it‚Äôs easier to understand, easy to setup, and translates well into Java code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What‚Äôs a Javascript mysterious man?<br>
A: Javascript is a high level (easy to write) scripting language mainly used for web/server development.<br>
Q: What‚Äôs a Java mysterious man?<br>
A: Javas is a high level object oriented (we put code into little boxes called objects that break up hard to understand things) programming language that is commonly used for desktop applications, and sometimes web apps.</p>

<h3 id="okay-okay-mysterious-man-how-do-i-get-started">Okay okay mysterious man, how do I get started</h3>
<p>Well for starting with javascript there‚Äôs this cool thing called Node.JS and NPM. Node.js is a way to write javascript code on the desktop and it makes it more similar to Java. NPM is a way to download libraries (other peoples code that we can openly use to make our lives easier)</p>

<h4 id="cool-now-you-have-npm-lets-get-an-ide">Cool now you have NPM, let‚Äôs get an IDE</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What‚Äôs an IDE?<br>
A: IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, aka a nice place to write code<br>
Take this wiki page if you don‚Äôt get it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">Boom.</a></p>

<h4 id="for-our-guide-well-be-using-vscode-for-2-reasons">For our guide we‚Äôll be using VSCode for 2 reasons</h4>
<ul>
<li>A: I am already intimately familiar with it, and it‚Äôs pretty nice</li>
<li>B: It is currently the standard IDE for First Robotics usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Download VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">HERE!</a></p>
<h4 id="by-the-way.">By the way.</h4>
<p>If you‚Äôre a security dork, don‚Äôt worry all of the projects linked in this document are <em>OPEN SOURCE</em> meaning you can look at the source code yourself if you really want. If that‚Äôs not enough‚Ä¶ you might have bigger issues. Here are the repository URLS for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VSCode</a>/<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">Node.js</a>/<a href="https://github.com/npm/cli">NPM</a>.<br>
If you‚Äôre a real beginner, please don‚Äôt worry about this. Build season is too short and if you trust me, the mysterious man of the past, you‚Äôll be fine!</p>

Wow, you‚Äôre the best, I love you, everyone loves you. If you‚Äôre a pro then go ahead and just look at some of my previous code for robotics to get the jist of what‚Äôs going on in the scene of robotics, Here‚Äôs some important links from me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Why are some of these in C++ in the earlier years?<br>
A: I like C++ but Java is easier to teach &amp; write, so we use Java!<br>
Q: Why is there code from FRC7265 &amp; FRC6214?<br>
A: I was on both teams!</p>
